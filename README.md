# BoSSS

BoSSS (Bounded Support Spectral Solver) is a flexible framework for the development, evaluation and applica-
tion of numerical discretization schemes based on the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method.


## Aim and focus of the BoSSS code

Its development has been initiated at the Chair of Fluid Dynamics in 2008 in order to establish a general foundation for the
development of higher order discretizations for challenging physical problems. Over the years, BoSSS developed
into fully-featured library for discontinuous Galerkin methods, including facilities for worflow management and
the rapid prototyping discretization of partial differential equations.
