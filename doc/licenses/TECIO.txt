Hi Thomas,

 

As the EULA is currently: "Utilities/Other Executables. Licensee is permitted to redistribute the included TECIO libraries and the PREPLOT executable for the sole purpose of generating binary files compatible with the Software." So, if you're using the included TECIO library, then you already have the ability to redistribute the binary. If you were wanting to redistribute the library included as your source, then you would need the updated EULA but ,for the binaries, you're fine.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,

Matthew

Hi Matthew,

Thank you for your reply.

We are planing on releasing our software in the next few weeks.
Do you already have a timeframe for the update of your EULA?

Basically we do not need the right to redistribute the source code of
TecIO - redistributing the binary would completely suffice.

Thanks in advance,

Thomas
