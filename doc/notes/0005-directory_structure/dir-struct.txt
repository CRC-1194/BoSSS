BoSSS DIRECTORY LAYOUT
================================================================================

BOSSS_ROOT              BoSSS root directory
 |                      usually recommended to be on the local hard drive (E.g. 
 |                      c:\BoSSS or C:\Users\nn\BoSSS or ~/BoSSS);
 |
 |--setvars.sh          Bash script, which appends BOSSS_ROOT/bin/Debug to the 
 |                      PATH, making tools like bcl.exe available from every
 |                      position in the directory structure
 |--setvars-release.sh  analogous, for BOSSS_ROOT/bin/Release
 |
 |
 |--src                 all source code (only present in developer edition of
 |   |                  BoSSS)
 |   |--public          a git repository
 |   |                  Contains the public available part of the BoSSS source
 |   |--DBE             a git repository;
 |   |                  Sourcecode of the database explorer
 |   |--protected       DEPRECIATED - not used anymore;
 |   |                  non-public available part of the BoSSS source
 |   |                  (parts of the L2 library BoSSS.Foundation)
 |   |--private         STRONGLY RECOMMENDED place for all user-specific parts
 |   |                  of BoSSS i.e. parts wich should not be available to all 
 |   |                  users at the current moment.
 |   |                  GENERAL RECOMENDATION: (1) for little changes in 
 |   |                  existing  projects, work with git branches,
 |   |                  for new developments or completly different projects 
 |   |                  use the private-directory;
 |   |                  (2) the user should also use git to track this 
 |   |                  directory;
 |   |--Utils           a git repository, containes the source for utils like 
 |   |                  bcl.exe
 |   |--MySolution      STRONGLY RECOMMENDED place for the Visual Studio 
 |                      Solution file(s) of the user.
 |  
 |--etc                 for allmost any configuration file

 |
 |--bin
 |   |--Debug           debug build of the managed parts (i.e. C#-coded parts) 
 |   |                  of BoSSS; files are transferred to here by
 |   |                  bcl bin-cb to-bin-dir 
 |   |--Release         release build of the managed parts (i.e. C#-coded parts) 
 |   |                  of BoSSS; files are transferred to here by
 |   |                  bcl bin-cb to-bin-dir 
 |   |--native          binaries (usually dynamically linked libraries) of the 
 |   |   |              platform-dependent
 |   |   |              parts of BoSSS (3rd party code like Hypre or MUMPS,
